#JobQueue

Implements a simple job queue/scheduler that applications can use to manage jobs.  While single-threaded, it should be simple to implement a version that's thread-safe.

## Samples

A game simulation executed through a series of Jobs using the JobQueue.

## Todos

- Implement a version that dispatches jobs to threads within a thread pool.
